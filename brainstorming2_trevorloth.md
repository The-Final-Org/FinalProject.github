Chatrooms
-
> Chatrooms is an app that allows users to connect through publicly accessable chatrooms by using a key that corresponds to a topic they may like.

- User Need

--There is always a demand for alternative chatting apps, even if not to an extreme extent



- Market Research

-- My unique selling point would be that you can enter public chatrooms that will use a describing feature as a key

-- Anyone with the same descripting key will be able to see and access messages from that room



- Feasibility

-- The app idea is not overly complex

-- This app utilized skills learned in the previous labs and projects

-- The hardest parts will be properly setting up a backend to store data on each chat room



- Time Frame

-- The time line of app development is realistically achievable by Unit 10



- Technical Constraints

-- This app would require a backend framework

-- The backend frame work will store messages in an organized way

-- The backend with also store user login data



- Scalability

-- The app has the potential to grow but mostly through the users

-- A possible update may be to allow people to share images

-- Another may be to create a home page where people can search through the existing chatroom will a high number of interaction
